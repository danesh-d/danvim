# danvim
My .vimrc configuration file.

Usage:
Just copy the file "vimrc" to your home directory and rename it to ".vimrc"!

If you wish to use "distinguished" color scheme, simply copy the file
"distinguished.vim" under "~/.vim/colors/" and uncomment the line:

"colorscheme distinguished

in the ".vimrc" file inlcuded in this repository.

That's it! Enjoy!
